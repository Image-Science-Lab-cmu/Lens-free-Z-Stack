# Lens-free Z-Stack

Code for reconstructing a 3D scene volume from lensless Z-stack measurements.

A example script for reconstruction 3D volumes from single measurement of different masks is provided at main_recons_different_masks_single_meas.m
This script will visualize the 3D point spread function (PSF) along with two reconstructions with different priors (l2 and l1).
It should produce the image below.
